## 1) Using range(),  make a range from 45 to 210, using a for loop iterate over the sequence and print the elements. Skip the number 100 and break the loop at 205

for i in range(45,210):
    
    if i == 100:
        continue
    
    elif i == 205:
        break

    print(i)


# 2) Using a while loop and input , do the following :
# Ask the the user : "what is the product of 7 * 24 ?"
# check if the answer is right then exit the loop and print "You answered this Question correctly"
# if the answer is wrong, then print "Your Answer is wrong try again.." and show the user the question again.


while True:
    answer = int(input("what is the product of 7 * 24 ?"))
    
    if  answer == 168:
        print("you answered this question correctly")
        break
    else:
            print("your answer is wrong try again..")
